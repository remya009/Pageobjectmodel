# Pageobjectmodel

I have used the page object model framework using Selenium with java to automate Zoho website
-have added multiple pages and created a parent Page class that inherits all the page classes
-have created a return page object for every method of page and optimized the code.
-Used log 4j to providee the logs
-Used Reportng to provide the reports
-Used Testng to run the scripts
-added listenerd to track all the pass/failed testcases
-added Testng data provider to send data
